# Ames House Price Prediction
Ames House Price Prediction is a Python machine learning project on housing data from Ames, Iowa.

This project is intended to set up a machine learning model using the train set to predict the sales price for each house in the test set. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price was used as the accuracy metric.
